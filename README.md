# DolarParaReal
A simple Application for Android with One Activity, using **Retrofit2**. 
The objective is to make a **Dolar** conversion to **Reais**. Making the interface from scratch and inserting some custom elements for the UI, using for screen prototype Adobe XD and afterwards converting for Android. 
Using a REST API(https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas) to get the price quote and convert the result for the end user.

# Todo:
To be honest since it's a test app, I'm not sure if it's going to be updated, but here is some simple ideas to improve the app itself.
- Click anywhere on the app to dispatch the keyboard.
- Create another function to convert Reals for Dolars using the Awesome API and Retrofit2.
